1 Setters for has many associations:
  # project.tasks << new_nask

  Impediment: has_many association doesn't know how current entity named in collections.
  For example: GeneralUser has_many Assignables, but Assignable doesn't have any
  GeneralUser directly - Assignable belongs to GeneralUser as owner.

2 (Need to discuss) belongs_to associations setters works fine when called on entity:
  # task.owner = general_user
  # task.save
  But we still can not pass entity inside #new:
  # task = TargetProcess::Task.new(name: "aaa", project: tp_project_instance)
  # task.save #=> Error
